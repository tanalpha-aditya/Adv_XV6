# Testing system calls

## Running Tests for getreadcount

Running tests for this syscall is easy. Just do the following from
inside the `initial-xv6` directory:

```sh
prompt> ./test-getreadcounts.sh
```

If you implemented things correctly, you should get some notification
that the tests passed. If not ...

The tests assume that xv6 source code is found in the `src/` subdirectory.
If it's not there, the script will complain.

The test script does a one-time clean build of your xv6 source code
using a newly generated makefile called `Makefile.test`. You can use
this when debugging (assuming you ever make mistakes, that is), e.g.:

```sh
prompt> cd src/
prompt> make -f Makefile.test qemu-nox
```

You can suppress the repeated building of xv6 in the tests with the
`-s` flag. This should make repeated testing faster:

```sh
prompt> ./test-getreadcounts.sh -s
```

## Running Tests for sigalarm and sigreturn

**After implementing both sigalarm and sigreturn**, do the following:
- Make the entry for `alarmtest` in `src/Makefile` inside `UPROGS`
- Run the command inside xv6:
    ```sh
    prompt> alarmtest
    ```

## Getting runtimes and waittimes for your schedulers
- Run the following command in xv6:
    ```sh
    prompt> schedulertest
    ```

## Running tests for entire xv6 OS
- Run the following command in xv6:
    ```sh
    prompt> usertests
    ```
